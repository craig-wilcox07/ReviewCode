# ReviewCode
This is how to open and review my code
Now that you have access to my prototype files, you need to download a software to open the code on, its called visual studio 2022 and its free to donwload and use, you just click on download and open it once you have it downloaded

Once you do that the file will come up in your downloads section in your files or you can click the file onc eits finihsed downloadingin the top right corner of your screen
Once you do that itll bring up that file whihc has a file called prototype_code_and_templates and also a readme file, clcik on the top file, then again and again for app, then once it bring up 5 different files click on the one called app which is a folder, then the bottom folder, then the top folder, then you can click on the python file at the top which will open the code.

open that file in visual studio that you just downloaded and it should bring up the code.
There are a few steps you need to complete before you can review my code, first of all you need to install a language called flask, you can do this by clicking on a yellow present button on the top bar

Once you click on that it will bring up a bar on the right side which is where you can install packages, search up flask in the search bar and once it loads click "Run command: pip install flask" it should be the top one of the list, after that do the same for each of the other ones "flask_login", "requests" and "flask_cors". Once youve done all that click the start button with the green arrow next to it, it should bring up a box which will say that it is running at a link which should be something along the lines of "https://localhost:5000", you now need to open a browser of any kind with the code still running and put in the link but at the end put a "/" and then "Homepage", once doing that you are now on the website if it loads. You can now use the form i have given you and the wesbite to work through the questions and give me soem improvements and rating of my website overall.
